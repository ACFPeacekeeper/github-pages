# Current Work
I'm currently a Artificial Intelligence Researcher at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/) - where I'm developing new Deep Reinforcement Learning methods to solve Combinatorial Optimization tasks - and a invited Assistant Professor at the Computer Science and Engineering department of [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), where I teach courses about [Distributed Systems](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/leic-t/disciplina-curricular/1408903891910867), [Cloud Computing and Virtualization](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meic-t/disciplina-curricular/1127428915200223) and [Computer Organization](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/leic-t/disciplina-curricular/1971853845332781).
I am also co-founding a Game Development studio called [Retsam Entertainment](https://twitter.com/RetsamGames) with [@jfperodrigues](https://github.com/jfperodrigues) and [@fafpinheiro](https://github.com/fafpinheiro).

# Previous Work
Previously, I was a Computer Programmer Analyst at the Research & Development department of [qubIT](http://www.qub-it.com/) and a Graduate Student Researcher at [GAIPS](https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/), where I developed new Multimodal Deep Learning architectures and learning frameworks.

# Academia
I studied for my [Bachelor of Science (BSc)](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/leic-t/curriculo?year=1972768673366017) and [Master of Science (MSc)](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/meic-t/curriculo?year=1128343743234050) degrees in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/). During my BSc, I learned about core concepts in Computer Science, Mathematics, Computer Hardware and Physics (along with some minor courses about HASS and Management) and I also participated in a [Athens Network](http://athensnetwork.eu/) exchange program at [Mines Paris - PSL](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), where I learned about Extreme Value Statistics. During my MSc, I did a double major in Artificial Intelligence and Cyber-Security (and also did some courses about Game Development) and I participated in a semester exchange program at [POSTECH](https://international.postech.ac.kr/), where I studied both CSE and Mathematics.

I'm currently taking a Advanced Formation Diploma in [Methodologies and Techniques of Scientific Research](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/MTIC/2021-2022/1-semestre/programa) and attending the [Mathematics for Machine Learning course](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/MAAut3/2023-2024/2-semestre/programa), both at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).

Beyond this, I also took MOOCs from several different universities to complement my academic knowledge or to learn more about subjects I'm interested in:
- From [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/):
    - [Eigenvalues - vapX](https://courses.elearning.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/courses/course-v1:MOOCs+vapX+2021/about);
    - [Machine Learning, Maths & Ethics: Hands-on - lematecX](https://courses.elearning.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/courses/course-v1:MOOCs+lematecX+2021/about);
    - [Markov Matrices - mmX](https://courses.elearning.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/courses/course-v1:MOOCs+mmX+2021/about).
- From [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/):
    - [Introduction to Computer Science - CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science);
    - [Christianity Through Its Scriptures](https://www.edx.org/learn/christianity/harvard-university-christianity-through-its-scriptures).
- From [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/):
    - [Machine Learning - XCS229](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs229-machine-learning).
- From [Cornell](https://www.cornell.edu/):
    - [Advanced Compilers - CS6120](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2020fa/self-guided/).

# Hobbies & Personal Projects
During my spare time, I enjoy reading books (Non-Fiction such as History and Politics, SciFi and Fantasy), playing games (RPGs, Action-Adventure, FPS, Strategy and Table Tops), listening to music and watching movies, anime and TV series.
Beyond this, I develop and code some personal projects, which are mostly in the realms of Cyber-Security, Artificial Intelligence and Game Development.
Currently, I'm also learning about Art and 3D Modelling to leverage that towards creating game assets.

# Other Interests & Activities
When I was in highschool at [Liceu Camões](https://liceucamoes.wixsite.com/camoes), my interest in politics led me to become a member of the youth wing of the portuguese [Socialist Party](https://ps.pt/), known in portuguese as [Juventude Socialista (JS)](https://juventudesocialista.pt/). During my time at JS, I worked on policies related to the environment, technology and innovation, education and economics. I also held positions as: 
- Vice-President of: my parish.
- Member of the secretariat of: my highschool, my parish of residence, my university, the Secondary and Higher Education committee of Lisbon, and the county of Lisbon;
- Member of the political comission of: the county of Lisbon, and the district of Lisbon.

During my time as a BSc and MSc student at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), I participated in several clubs related to the university: as a developer at [HackerSchool](https://hackerschool.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), as a marketing assistant at [LabJogos](https://labjogos.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en), as the EBEC Information Technology responsible for [BEST Lisbon](https://best.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), and as a member of the student newspaper [Diferencial](https://diferencial.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/).

I volunteered as a Computer Science Instructor at [TreeTree2](https://www.treetree2.org/), at the [Rua com Saída](http://voxlisboa.pt/rua-com-sa%c3%adda.html) project of the [VOXLisboa Association](http://voxlisboa.pt/index.html) for the homeless and as a staff member of the team of the TORNADU debate tournament organized by [CNADU](https://debates.pt/).

Beyond volunteer work, I was a debater at [SDAL](http://sdal.weebly.com/), where I participated in several debate tournaments: TORNADU 2019 (Initiate 2nd place), Open Lisbon V (Initiate 3rd place + Initiate Brake), CMDLP 2019 (Initiate 1st place + Initiate Brake), Open da Católica III (Finalist + Top 10 Speaker), Open do Tejo III (Finalist + Top 10 Speaker).
I was also part of the CA Team of the Open Centro Sul 2021, and worked as both a Member of the Board at IST and (later) as the Secretary General of [SDAL](http://sdal.weebly.com/).
