I'm currently a Artificial Intelligence Researcher at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/) - where I'm developing new Reinforcement Learning methods to solve Combinatorial Optimization tasks such as the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem - and a invited Assistant Professor at the Computer Science and Engineering department of [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).
I am also co-founding a Games Development company called Retsam Entertainment, where I'm currently learning abou Art and 3D Modelling towards creating game assets.

Previously, I was a Computer Programmer Analyst at the Research & Development department of [qubIT](http://www.qub-it.com/) and a Multimodal Deep Learning Graduate Student Researcher at [GAIPS](https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/).
I also volunteered as a Computer Science Instructor at [TreeTree2](https://www.treetree2.org/), as a developer at [HackerSchool](https://hackerschool.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), as a Marketing Assistant at [LabJogos](https://labjogos.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en) and as the EBEC IT Responsible for [BEST Lisbon](https://best.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/).

During my spare time, I enjoy reading books (History, Politics, Economics, SciFi, etc.), playing games (RPGs, Action-Adventure, FPS, Strategy, Table Tops), listening to music and watching both movies and TV series.
I also work towards some of my personal programming projects, which are mostly in the realms of Cyber-Security, Artificial Intelligence and Game Development.
