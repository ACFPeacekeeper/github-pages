# Current Work
I'm currently a Artificial Intelligence Researcher at [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/) - where I'm developing new Deep Reinforcement Learning methods to solve Combinatorial Optimization tasks such as the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem - and a invited Assistant Professor at the Computer Science and Engineering department of [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).
I am also co-founding a Games Development studio called [Retsam Entertainment](https://twitter.com/RetsamGames) with [@jfperodrigues](https://github.com/jfperodrigues) and [@fafpinheiro](https://github.com/fafpinheiro).

# Previous Work
Previously, I was a Computer Programmer Analyst at the Research & Development department of [qubIT](http://www.qub-it.com/) and a Graduate Student Researcher at [GAIPS](https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/), where I developed Robust Multimodal Deep Learning Models.
I also volunteered as a Computer Science Instructor at [TreeTree2](https://www.treetree2.org/), as a developer at [HackerSchool](https://hackerschool.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), as a Marketing Assistant at [LabJogos](https://labjogos.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en) and as the EBEC Information Technology Responsible for [BEST Lisbon](https://best.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/).

# Academia
I studied for my BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), where I majoured in both Artificial Intelligence and Cyber-Security. During my BSc, I participated in a [Athens Network](http://athensnetwork.eu/) exchange program at [Mines Paris - PSL](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) - where I learned about Extreme Value Statistics - and, during my MSc, I participated in a semester exchange program at [POSTECH](https://international.postech.ac.kr/), where I studied both CSE and Mathematics.
I'm currently taking a Advanced Formation Diploma in Methodologies and Techniques of Scientific Research and attending the Mathematics for Machine Learning course, both at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/).

# Hobbies & Personal Projects
During my spare time, I enjoy reading books (Non-Fiction such as History and Politics, SciFi and Fantasy), playing games (RPGs, Action-Adventure, FPS, Strategy and Table Tops), listening to music and watching movies, anime and TV series.
Beyond this, I develop and code some personal projects, which are mostly in the realms of Cyber-Security, Artificial Intelligence and Game Development.
Currently, I'm also learning about Art and 3D Modelling to leverage that towards creating game assets.
