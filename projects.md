## Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)
### Artificial Intelligence Research
#### CSE Master of Science (MSc) Dissertation
Towards the completion of my CSE MSc degree at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), I worked as a Graduate Student Researcher at [GAIPS](https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/), where I wrote a Dissertation titled ['Leveraging Deep Unsupervised Models Towards Learning Robust Multimodal Representations'](docs/IST_UL___MEIC_Thesis___Dissertacao_final__Copy_.pdf). For this Dissertation, I developed three new Multimodal Deep Unsupervised Models - which combined principles from [Denoising Auto-Encoders](docs/related_work/2003.05991.pdf), [Geometric Multimodal Contrastive Learning](docs/related_work/2202.03390.pdf) and [Odd-One-Out Networks](docs/related_work/1611.06646.pdf) - and compared their robustness against missing modalities, noisy data and adversarial examples with other deep multimodal models such as the [MVAE](docs/related_papers/1802.05335.pdf). The final document and the respective code are the following (I also wrote a paper, but I still want to improve it before posting it to ARXIV):

#### WSmart Route+
During my formation in Methodologies and Techniques of Scientific Research, I worked on the [WSmart Route+](https://cegist.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/projects/wsmart-route-towards-smart-waste-collection-route-planning-system) project, which seeks to expand upon the research to develop a system for waste collection based on a real time route planning sytem made during the [WSmart Route](https://wsmartroute.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/#title) project, which was funded by the [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/en/) foundation and the [MIT Portugal](https://mitportugal.org/) program and combines efforts from [Ersuc](https://ersuc.pt/), [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), the [University of Coimbra](https://www.uc.pt/), [EVOX Technologies](https://evox.pt/) and the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/). I am trying to develop new [Deep Reinforcement Learning](docs/related_work/1811.12560.pdf) methods to solve [Combinatorial Optimization](docs/related_work/2003.03600.pdf) tasks, particularly the [Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with Fuzzy Demand](docs/related_work/werners_drawe_ch_cvrpfd.pdf) (which is an instance of the [CVRP](docs/related_work/2110.02629.pdf)). Here are some publications related to the project:

### Web Development
#### EBEC 2020
During my time as the Information Technology responsible for EBEC 2020, which was organized by [BEST Lisbon](https://best.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), I developed a website for the event with the [Mandalorian TV series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8111088/) as its theme:
